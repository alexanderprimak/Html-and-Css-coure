                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                 when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                 t has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                 It was popularised in the 1960s with the release.</p>

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, 
                    from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. </p>
